# Chase-s-Secure-Password-Generator

## Description

This project allows a user to input a set of criteria and receive a randomized password with their criteria. If they want it to be 128 characters in length and all capital letters, then that is what they will get.

- I wanted to provide a way of quickily providing a random, system generated password.
- This allows users to obtain a more secure password instead of electing to use password123.
- I learned how to integrate functions in with if else statements along with user choices defining what the application does.

## Installation

User can access the generator at: https://chasechambers.github.io/Secure-Password-Generator/

## Usage

Once the user navigates to the webpage, they click the 'generate password' button. A system of prompts will allow them to elect a password between 8-128 characters. After that, they will choice if they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. After all that is done, the system will return the password. This can be done multiple times.

## Credits

I worked on this with references to websites such as W3 schools, MDN, and stack overflow to look up basic commands and language.


## Tests

Tests can be done by electing anything between 8-128 characters. If anythin below 8 or above 128 is elected, the system should stop trying to generate a password. 

The user can also choose any and all options. If they say no on everything, the system should not generate a password.
